# üéì AI Insights for Drupal ‚Äî Draft (Work in Progress)

> **Note:**  
> This document is a living draft.  
> It serves as a working space to collect, refine, and evolve ideas around the use of AI and machine learning in Drupal ‚Äî specifically for higher-education websites.  
> Items here may be modified, added, or removed as research and experiments progress.


## 1. The Problem

University websites host hundreds or even thousands of pages ‚Äî academic programs, faculty profiles, research articles, and events.  
While Google Analytics 4 provides raw data and automated ‚ÄúAnalytics Intelligence‚Äù insights, these insights are:

- **Generic:** not contextualized to the structure or goals of academic content.  
- **Closed:** visible only inside the GA4 dashboard, without CMS integration.  
- **Non-predictive:** they describe what happened, not what will happen.  
- **Disconnected:** they don‚Äôt link engagement metrics back to real Drupal entities like content types, authors, or taxonomies.

As a result, higher-education teams often struggle to **translate analytics into meaningful actions** ‚Äî like which programs to promote, which events need visibility, or which outdated content should be updated.

## 2. The Opportunity

Drupal already powers a significant portion of higher-education websites, offering structured content and robust editorial workflows.  
However, it lacks a native way to **interpret performance data** in an intelligent, narrative-driven way.

By combining Drupal‚Äôs structured data with GA4‚Äôs analytics and modern AI tools, we can build a solution that:

- Transforms analytics into **actionable insights** directly inside Drupal.  
- Predicts which content will drive future engagement.  
- Identifies outdated or redundant pages automatically.  
- Generates weekly or monthly summaries in **natural, human-readable language**.

> In short: **AI Insights for Drupal** turns analytics into strategy ‚Äî inside the CMS universities already use.

## 3. The Solution: AI Insights for Drupal

**AI Insights for Drupal** is an analytics and intelligence suite that brings AI-driven insights directly into the Drupal admin interface.  
It analyzes traffic and content data, predicts engagement trends, and generates narrative summaries contextualized for university websites.

## 4. How It Differs from Google Analytics Insights

| Feature | Google Analytics Intelligence | AI Insights for Drupal |
|----------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| Insight Source | GA4 data only | GA4 + Drupal entities (content, taxonomies, authors) |
| Context | Generic web metrics | Academic content context |
| Access | Inside GA4 dashboard only | Inside Drupal Admin |
| Narrative | Automated cards (short phrases) | Full natural-language summaries |
| Predictive | Descriptive only | Predictive (ML-based) |
| Integration | Closed system | Open, modular, extensible |

---

## 5. Architecture Overview

| Layer | Technology | Responsibilities |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Drupal Layer** | Drupal 10/11 (PHP) | Dashboard UI, GA4 data integration, AI narrative generation, and API communication with Python services. |
| **Python Layer (Premium)** | FastAPI + Pandas + scikit-learn | Performs data aggregation, pattern detection, and predictive analytics. Returns structured results (JSON). |
| **AI Narrative Layer** | Drupal AI module + LLM provider | Translates numerical results into clear, contextual insights. |
| **Machine Learning Layer (Premium)** | scikit-learn / Prophet / spaCy | Handles training and inference for engagement prediction and content health scoring. |
