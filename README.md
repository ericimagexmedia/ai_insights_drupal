# Ai Insights for Drupal
**AI Insights for Drupal** is a modular analytics and intelligence toolkit built for Drupal websites — designed especially for higher-education institutions and content-driven organizations that want to understand how their content performs, without the complexity of external dashboards.

Instead of relying on the Google Analytics console, this module brings the most important insights directly into Drupal, in an editor-friendly and action-oriented interface — with automatic summaries, clear visual reports, and almost zero configuration.

## Summary

**AI Insights for Drupal** isn’t just a simplified copy of Google Analytics. It’s a purpose-built solution for content editors, marketing teams, and site managers who need actionable insights where they work — inside Drupal.

By turning analytics into clear narratives and editor-friendly visuals, the module helps teams **understand, communicate, and improve** content performance with ease.

## Motivation
Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is powerful, but its interface can be complex and intimidating for content editors. **AI Insights for Drupal** bridges that gap by making analytics approachable and meaningful inside the CMS.

- **Per-page insights**: Each content node can display its own analytics and highlights.
- **Editor-friendly UI**: Simple, contextual, and focused on what matters.
- **No complex setup**: Connect your GA4 property once — no manual configuration required.
- **Action over data**: The goal isn’t to show more numbers, but to surface what needs attention.


## Core Features

### 1. GA4 connection and basic analytics dashboard
Connect your Drupal site to Google Analytics 4 using an API key or property ID. A built-in dashboard displays key performance metrics such as:
 - Pageviews, average engagement time, and bounce/scroll metrics.
 - Comparison over time (e.g., last 7 vs. last 30 days).
> Example: “This page received 32% more views than the previous week.”

### 2. Top-performing pages and time-on-page metrics
Lists pages with the best performance and identifies those losing momentum. Can be filtered by content type or taxonomy.
> Example: “The Admissions page kept users for an average of 1m 42s — 25% above the site average.”

### 3. Basic ‘content freshness’ report

Detects outdated or low-traffic pages and highlights content that may need review. Perfect for editorial and marketing teams planning updates.

> Example: “The Our Campus page hasn’t received significant visits in 45 days — consider updating it.”

### 4. Short AI-generated summary (using Drupal AI)
Uses the Drupal AI module to generate natural-language summaries of analytics data.

> Example: “Business Administration BBA shows steady growth and maintains the highest average read time this month.”

### 5. Optional lightweight engagement scoring
Applies a simple rule-based/static model to assign an “engagement score” to each node.
> Example: “Engagement Score: **82 / 100** — high performance, driven by above-average time-on-page and strong scroll depth.”
